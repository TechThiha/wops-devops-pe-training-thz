1. Download the file using **wget**.

```bash
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khantnaingset-kns/wops-devops-pe-training-kns/main/hm1.txt"
```

1. Open the file by using **cat** and we will get the output of the file.

```bash
cat hm1.txt
```

1. For this, we use **grep** command to take out the words and count the words.

```bash
grep -io "AI" hm1.txt |wc -l
grep -io "NLP" hm1.txt |wc -l
```

1. In this step, we need to use sed command to replace the word from AI to genAI.

```bash
sed -i "s/AI/genAI/g' hm1.txt
```

If we have to save it in the other location, we can use this command.

```bash
cat hm1.txt | sed "s/AI/genAi/g" - > modified.txt
```

1. The Results.
